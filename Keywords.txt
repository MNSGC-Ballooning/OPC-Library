Commands for OPCSensor library

All OPC:
 - construct with a reference to the serial port name (&serialName), and separately begin the serial connection.
 - .getTot() - returns total number of hits
 - .getLogQuality() - returns the quality of the log
 - .initOPC() - will initialize the OPC
 - .CSVHeader() - will provide a header for the logUpdate data string
 - .logUpdate() - will return a data string in CSV format
 - .readData() - will read the data and return a bool indicating success
 - .setReset(int) - will manually set the automatic bad log reset time. The default is 20 minutes of constantly poor logging. This will cause a 21 second delay in the code operation.

Classes:
Plantower
- add an additional log rate in milliseconds as a second parameter to the constructor

SPS
- .powerOn() - used to start measurements (called by initOPC)
- .powerOff() - used to end measurements
- .clean() - used to clean the system (called by initOPC)

R1
- constructed with a slave pin instead of a serial line
- .powerOn() - used to start full system (called by initOPC)
- .powerOff() - used to end measurements
